# Sample Data - Study Buddies

The names of the files in this folder correspond to the names of the database tables into which the sample data will be loaded. For example, you can use the user loaded from `users.json` to log in without needing to register a user every time the database is recreated. 

The sample data consist of JSON files, each of which has a list of object representing one row of the database - each object should have all the columns that need to be inserted.

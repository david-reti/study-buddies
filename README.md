# Study Buddies

This is the repository for our mobile application project. Unlike in a more conventional workflow, we'll keep all the parts of the project (flutter app, API and any additional data) in separate folders within this repository, for greater convenience.

## Development Workflow

Here's how the project will be developed:

1. Group members clone the repository
2. Group members make changes by working on their part in their respective folder
3. Instead of pushing to main, group members will push to their own branched (at least 1 per person)
4. When a group member has completed their part, we'll look over their code in our weekly meeting and merge it
5. When the code is merged, the repository will be automatically pulled on our AWS server and become accessible

Any ongoing tasks can be found in their respective branches; As a team we will discuss merging and updates on our group on MS Teams.
